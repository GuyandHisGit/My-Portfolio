      <p>
        Think of me as a curious coder who loves both structure and spontaneity.  
        I believe in writing code that's clean, scalable, and sprinkled with a bit of joy.  
        I like listening more than assuming, breaking big problems into tiny ones,  
        and obsessing over the little details ‚Äî because they always matter.
